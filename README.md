HERE A SHORT PARAGRAPH DESCRIBING HOW YOU PERFORMED THE TASK

To complete the task of designing an e-learning platform UI using HTML and CSS, I started by planning the structure of the platform, focusing on key components like the navigation bar, course cards, and a responsive layout. Using HTML, I created the basic skeleton of the webpage, including elements such as headers, sections for featured courses, and user interaction buttons. I then styled the interface with CSS to ensure a clean, modern lookâ€”incorporating a consistent color scheme, readable typography, and hover effects for interactivity.
